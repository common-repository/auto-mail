<h3>ABANDONED CART RECOVERY IN WOOCOMMERCE</h3>
<p>Research shows that about 70 to 80% of customers abandon their carts and leave your store without buying. At least 40 to 60% of these abandoned carts can be recovered by sending well-timed, series of email reminders.</p>
<p><a href="https://wpautomail.com/pricing/" target="_blank">Auto Mail</a> helps you <strong>automatically send recovery emails</strong> when customers abandon their carts. You can schedule a series of well-timed email reminders that can be sent to the customers to recover their carts and complete the purchase. ðŸš€</p>

<h3>Here is an example:</h3>
<ul>
<li>First email is sent 30 minutes after the customer abandoned the cart</li>
<li>Second email is sent 6 hours after the abandonment automatically</li>
<li>Third email can be sent a day after. This time, include a coupon code in the email. Each customer can be sent a unique, single-use coupon code</li>
<li>Fourth abandoned cart reminder goes 3 days after (if the cart still remains un-recovered)</li>
</ul>

<p>All these abandoned cart email reminders can be scheduled and sent automatically. No need to manually send these emails.</p>
